# Lightweight BP Chat Application

This project aims to build a **lightweight messaging application** with the functionality and feasibility of mainstream peer-to-peer (P2P) chat applications. It leverages the [bp-sockets repository](https://github.com/juanfraire/bp-sockets) interface to demonstrate communication over the Bundle Protocol (BP). 

**Start Date:** 12/14  
**Current Status:** Ongoing Development  

## To Build Features

- **P2P Communication**: Exchange messages between peers using `bpsocket`.
- **Interactive Terminal UI**: Easy-to-use text-based interface for sending and receiving messages.
- **Lightweight Design**: Focused on minimal dependencies and efficient performance.
- **Real-Time Messaging**: Supports simultaneous message sending and receiving.

## Prerequisites
To run this application, you need:
1. The [bp-sockets repository](https://github.com/juanfraire/bp-sockets) properly installed and configured.
2. The BP Sockets kernel module and daemon running on the system.
3. A C compiler like GCC or Clang with support for `bpsocket`.
